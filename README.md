* Why Java? It's stable and fast. GPL with classpath exception, and we don't distribute sources of Java itself.
* Why Jetty? It may reduce memory footprint compared to enterprise servers like Wildfly or Glassfish. Tomcat leaks memory. Apache 2.0 License.
* Why Wicket? It may boost development speed of small and medium-size web applications.Â I still prefer Scala+Playframework2, but there we need to use pure Java to reduce memory footprint. Apache 2.0 License.
* Spring and Hibernate are established Java standards. Both Apache 2.0 License.
* Spring Security is out of the box security implementation (and Wicket native implementation is not good at all). Apache 2.0 License.
* SQLite is the only popular embedded database with good license (not GPL and AGPL). License - no license, public domain. JDBC connector is under Apache 2.0 License.
* SB Admin 3 is light theme based on Bootstrap 3 and designed in LESS. Apache 2.0 License.
